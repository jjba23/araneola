;; ====== Agent skills ======

;; module it comes from.

;; AGENTS.md is generated, never edited by hand.  The section has two halves:
;; the data below, which is this project's, and the task itself, which is not.
;; Another repository copies the whole section and replaces the data - the
;; header, the pinned skills (repository, commit, path, licence) and the
;; practices - and `maak agents' writes its own AGENTS.md.  Regeneration is
;; deterministic: the same pins and the same text produce the same file, byte
;; for byte, and it needs nothing but curl.  The skill URLs assume GitHub, so a
;; skill hosted elsewhere needs a URL of its own.

over general advice, and the narrowest rule here wins over the broadest.
")

;; Practices this project keeps.  They are short on purpose: a rule a reader
;; checks in a second is a rule that gets followed.  The pinned skills are the
;; long form of the same habits.
(define agent-practices
  (list
   "## Documentation

- Every user-visible change reaches the documentation: the page that owns the
  feature, the manual page for a flag or an environment variable, and the
  release notes under the unreleased heading.
- Keep the table of contents in step with the headings.  A section with no entry
  is a section nobody finds.
- The guide is Org: one `*` heading per page, `**` for sections, `#+TITLE` and
  `#+EMAIL` at the top, a `CUSTOM_ID` on anything linked from elsewhere, and
  `file:` links between pages.
- Explain why and when, never what: the code already says what.  A docstring's
  first line works as a summary on its own.
- Spell an identifier the way the code spells it - the exact name, not a
  description of it.
- An example must run as written, copied from a real invocation.
- No promises about the future and no changelog in the guide; history lives in
  the release notes.
"
   "## Security

- No secrets in the tree.  Tokens, keys and passwords arrive through the
  environment, and no recipe, workflow or example embeds one.
- Validate at the edge: anything from a file, a report, a path or a subprocess
  is untrusted until it has been checked.
- Never build a shell string out of data.  Tasks pass argument lists, and Guile
  calls `(system \"program\" \"arg\")` or `open-pipe*`, never a command
  assembled with `string-append`.
- Do not `eval` or `read` input you did not write; parse with `(json)` or a
  reader built for the format.
- Escape what leaves the process: a name that came from input is escaped when
  it is written to XML, HTML or a data file.
- Fail closed.  A file that cannot be read is an error, not an empty result.
- Input never chooses the path of a written file; writes stay inside the
  directory reserved for them.
- A dependency is a security decision: it must be needed, MIT compatible and
  pinned.
- Report a vulnerability privately, not in a public issue.
"
   "## Performance

- Measure first.  A before and after belongs in the benchmark, and a speedup
  claimed without a number is not a speedup.
- Prefer not doing the work: cache it, skip it, batch it, or delete the call,
  before making the call faster.
- Then the algorithm, then the data structure (hash table, vector), then the
  micro-optimisation.  In that order, for that reason.
- Guile specifics: keep module resolution and long `assoc` chains out of loops,
  use `#:declarative?` modules and compiled `.go` files at startup, and reach
  for `statprof` instead of guessing where the time goes.
- A shortcut that buys speed costs clarity; it gets a measurement and a
  `shortcut:` comment saying what it costs and when to revisit it.
- Coverage instrumentation is slow by design: iterate without it, and measure
  before finishing.
"
   "## Architecture decisions

- A decision that is expensive to reverse gets a short record: the context, the
  decision, the consequences, and the alternatives that lost.  A small decision
  belongs in the commit body instead.
- Two paragraphs beat a design document; record the choice while it is still a
  choice, not after it has become a fact.
- An accepted record is not rewritten.  Supersede it with a new one and link the
  two directions.
- The record lives next to its subject: the documentation for anything a user
  would notice, the release notes for the release-level result.
- Changes to the public API, a file format, the pipeline or the licence get this
  treatment at a minimum in the commit body.
"
   "## Semantic versioning

- The project follows SemVer 2.0.0 for its public API: the exported functions,
  the CLI flags and environment variables, and the shape of its file formats.
- A breaking change bumps MAJOR, a new feature MINOR, a fix PATCH.  A new export
  is MINOR; removing or changing one is MAJOR.
- One version string, named everywhere it appears: the source, the build
  recipes, the manual page and the packaging.
- A release is a dated release-notes section, an annotated `vX.Y.Z` tag on the
  release commit, and a packaging checksum updated afterwards from the published
  archive.
"
   "## Conventional commits

- `type(scope): summary`, imperative, lower case, no full stop, about seventy
  characters.
- Types in use: `feat`, `fix`, `perf`, `refactor`, `test`, `docs`, `build`, `ci`,
  `chore`.  A `!` after the type or a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer marks a MAJOR
  change, and says what breaks.
- The subject says what changed.  The body says why, and what was rejected.
- One logical change per commit: a refactor and a fix travel apart, so either
  can be reverted alone.
- Run the full validation task before committing, and never commit a red suite
  without saying so in the message.
- Reference the issue in the footer - `Closes #12` - not in the subject.
"
   "## Functional programming and immutability

- Pure functions in the core, effects at the edges.  Whatever touches the file
  system or the clock sits at the edge; the core does not.
- Prefer `let` and new values to `set!`.  Build results with `map`, `filter`,
  `fold` and named `let`, not with index loops that push into a list.
- A record is a value: construct a new one instead of mutating a shared one, and
  pass configuration as arguments or parameters rather than as globals.
- Handle an exception at the boundary: catch it there, turn it into a result
  record, and let the caller decide what it means.
- A function that both computes and prints is two functions.
- Temporary effects - a changed directory, a bound environment variable - go
  through `dynamic-wind`.
- Prefer the expression style: `if` and `cond` that return a value, not a branch
  that assigns one.
"
   "## Do not reinvent the wheel

- Guile's standard library first: `(ice-9 ...)` for the runtime, `(srfi srfi-1)`
  for lists, `(srfi srfi-9)` for records, `(srfi srfi-13)` for strings, `(json)`
  for JSON.  The project already depends on all of them.
- Then this codebase: read the existing modules before writing a helper, and use
  the one that is nearly right instead of adding a second one.
- A new dependency needs a reason the standard library cannot meet, a licence
  the project can carry, and a paragraph in the commit body.
- Prefer deleting a special case to writing code that handles it.
- The best diff removes lines and keeps the behaviour; the second best is a
  small diff that is obvious a year later.
